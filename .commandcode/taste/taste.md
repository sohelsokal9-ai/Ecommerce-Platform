# Social Oauth
- When adding a social OAuth integration (e.g., GitHub, Google), follow this structure: 1) Create `src/lib/social-oauth/` with encryption (AES-256-GCM), state (HMAC-signed CSRF), and an index.ts with OAuth URLs/token exchange/refresh/user API helpers, 2) Create `src/models/{provider}-account.model.ts`, 3) Create `src/services/{provider}.service.ts` with connect/callback/getAccessToken/disconnect, 4) Create `src/controllers/{provider}.controller.ts` with Zod validation, 5) Create `src/routes/{provider}.route.ts`, 6) Update env.config.ts, routes/index.ts, and .env/.env.example. Confidence: 0.70

# Admin Routes
- When creating admin API routes, always apply `passportAuthenticateJwt` and `requireAdmin` middleware at the router level via `adminRoutes.use(passportAuthenticateJwt)` and `adminRoutes.use(requireAdmin)` rather than per-route. Mount admin routes under `/api/admin` in `routes/index.ts`. Confidence: 0.80

# Image Upload Pipeline
- When building a product image upload pipeline, use this chain: 1) `multer` with memory storage + file filter (allow only image MIME types: jpeg, png, webp, gif) + file size limit (5MB) + max file count (10), 2) A `validateFilesPresence` middleware to reject requests with no files, 3) A `cloudinary.util.ts` that uses `streamifier.createReadStream(buffer).pipe(uploadStream)` to upload buffers to Cloudinary. Confidence: 0.80

# Stripe Checkout
- When building Stripe checkout sessions, include delivery fee and tax as separate line items (not just product prices) so the Stripe checkout total matches `orderTotal` exactly. Delivery fee line item should only be included when non-zero. Confidence: 0.75

# Frontend Loading States
- For admin/dashboard pages, use the `<Skeleton>` component (with `animate-pulse rounded-md bg-muted`) for loading states instead of `<Spinner>`. Skeletons provide a better perceived performance for data-heavy dashboard layouts. Confidence: 0.85

# Admin Pagination
- For admin list pages (orders, products), use server-side pagination driven by the API's `pagination` response object (`{ page, limit, total, totalPages, hasNextPage, hasPrevPage }`). Do not implement client-side slicing of the full dataset — the API already returns paginated results. Derive `totalPages`, `startIndex`, and `endIndex` from the pagination metadata, not from the local array length. Confidence: 0.70

# Admin Table Styling
- For admin table pages, use reduced padding: `px-6 py-2` for both `<TableCell>` and `<TableHead>` (instead of `px-6 py-3`/`px-6 py-4`). This provides a denser, more data-focused layout consistent across admin list views (orders and products pages both use this pattern). Confidence: 0.80

# Resource Scaffolding
- When scaffolding a new resource (e.g., session, product, blog), follow this pattern: 1) Controllers use `asyncHandler` wrapper, and protected routes extract `_id` from `req.user`, 2) Validation schemas go in `src/validators/`, 3) Services export scaffolded function stubs that return placeholder text responses, 4) Routes use `passportAuthenticateJwt` middleware for protected endpoints. Confidence: 0.70
- Controllers must include a `message` field in every JSON response (e.g., `{ message: "Sessions retrieved successfully", sessions }`), not just return data without a message. Follow the existing pattern from auth and github controllers. Confidence: 0.65

# MongoDB
- Use `session.withTransaction()` instead of `startTransaction()`/`commitTransaction()`/`abortTransaction()` for cleaner code. `withTransaction()` auto-commits on success and auto-aborts on error, eliminating manual session management. Confidence: 0.70
